Like I just said this small gameproject based on a Arkanoid type game, easy simple gamemechanic. I Created this little project though during class at the GPB to learn how implement proper Game States
and avoid making If or Enum Spagethi!!  The different Gamestates in this project are for the player ship and ball ( expanding the ship size / increasing ship speed / Multiball / increase ball speed / more lifes etc.. to mention a few states)
